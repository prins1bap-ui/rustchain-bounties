# Contributing to RustChain Bounties

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RustChain bounties! This guide explains how to participate in the bounty program, claim tasks, submit proofs, and earn RTC tokens.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/my-contribution`)
4. **Make your changes** and test them
5. **Commit** with a clear message
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request**

## 💰 Earning RTC Tokens

All merged contributions earn RTC tokens! See the bounty tiers:

| Tier | Reward | Examples |
| ---- | ------ | -------- |
| Micro | 1-10 RTC | Typo fix, small docs, simple test |
| Standard | 20-50 RTC | Feature, refactor, new endpoint |
| Major | 75-100 RTC | Security fix, consensus improvement |
| Critical | 100-150 RTC | Vulnerability patch, protocol upgrade |

Browse the [live open-bounty queue](https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty) to find currently open tasks with specific RTC rewards. For the canonical claim and submission rules, see [How to Submit a Bounty PR That Actually Gets Paid](docs/HOW_TO_SUBMIT_A_BOUNTY.md).

## 🎯 Bounty Workflow Guide

### Finding Bounties
1. Go to the [live open-bounty queue](https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty)
2. Choose an issue labeled `bounty` and read the full issue, acceptance criteria, reward, and current comments before starting
3. Check whether the work is already claimed, submitted, merged, or paid; stale open issues can still have completed work in their thread
4. **Important**: Read the [Anti-Farming Rules (#452)](https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/issues/452) and the [canonical submission guide](docs/HOW_TO_SUBMIT_A_BOUNTY.md) before claiming any bounty

### Claiming a Bounty
1. **Claim it**: Comment `/claim` on the bounty issue before you begin work
2. **Treat the claim as a courtesy signal, not a lock**: Claims last 7 days and help other contributors avoid duplicate work, but they do not reserve payment
3. **Check the automation response**: If the issue is already claimed or the work is already complete, move to another bounty instead of racing a known duplicate
4. **Renew only when needed**: If your claim lapses while you are still actively working, comment `/claim` again to renew it

### Why claims get turned down

Almost every declined claim we see falls into one of these. None of them are about the quality of your code, and none of them are personal. They are just the things that make a claim impossible to verify or pay.

**The deliverable is the thing itself, not a file describing it.**
If a bounty asks you to star a repo, record a video, publish a post, join the Discord, or review an open PR, then the star, the video, the post, the membership, or the review is the work. Adding a Python file named after the issue number does not complete it. Several of these arrive every week and none of them can be paid, because there is nothing to check.

**A file nothing imports is not a fix.**
Dropping `fix_1234.py` in the repository root, where no module imports it and no test covers it, does not change the behaviour the bounty is about. Change the code that actually runs, and add a test that fails before your change and passes after it.

**Evidence has to be checkable by someone who is not you.**
Links are opened. Stars are checked through the GitHub API. Videos are watched. If a link 404s, if a submission still contains placeholder text like `[your hardware here]`, or if a claimed star does not appear on your account, the claim cannot be verified and will be declined even if you did the work. Post the real artifact.

**Use one wallet, consistently.**
Pick one payout identity and keep it. When the same person claims under two different wallets, we cannot tell which one is theirs, and payment stops until it is resolved. If you need to change your payout address, say so plainly in one place rather than switching mid-stream.

**Check the work is not already done.**
Read the whole thread before claiming. A good number of claims arrive for bounties that were already paid, or for bugs someone else already fixed and merged. It costs you nothing to check and it saves you writing something that cannot be accepted.

**Do not paste the same claim on several issues.**
One claim per bounty, in your own words, describing what you will actually do. Identical text across multiple threads reads as volume rather than intent, and it makes the genuine claims underneath it harder to find.

**Racing is normal and it is not personal.**
Several people often work the same bounty. Where submissions are comparable, the first mergeable one usually wins, and the rest get closed with thanks. That is not a judgement about your work. If yours was close, say so and we will point you at something unclaimed.

### If you are new and unsure

Ask in the issue before you start. A short comment saying what you plan to do takes a minute and saves you from building the wrong thing. We would much rather answer a question up front than decline finished work.

### Wallet Format
- **Use wallet names, not addresses**: `your-wallet-name` (e.g., `BetsyMalthus`)
- **Do not include cryptocurrency addresses** in comments
- Wallet names are used to track RTC earnings in the ledger

### Proof Requirements
For bounties requiring proof of completion:
1. **Screenshots**: Clear, full-screen screenshots showing the working feature
2. **Code snippets**: Relevant sections of implemented code
3. **Test results**: Output from test commands
4. **Video demonstrations** (optional): For complex UI/UX features

### Submission Process
1. **Complete the work** in your forked repository
2. **Create a Pull Request** to the main repository
3. **Link to the issue**: In your PR description, include `Closes #<issue_number>`
4. **Provide proof**: Attach screenshots or other required proof in the PR comments
5. **Wait for review**: Maintainers will review within 48-72 hours

### After Approval
1. **PR merged**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
2. **RTC distribution**: RTC tokens will be distributed to your wallet name
3. **Ledger update**: Your earnings will be recorded in [BOUNTY_LEDGER.md](BOUNTY_LEDGER.md)

## Payout Authority

Only `@Scottcjn` (or a clearly labeled project automation account speaking on his behalf, with a matching project-issued `pending_id` + `tx_hash`) authorizes RTC bounty disbursements. Anyone else posting "I'll send the RTC" on a bounty issue is not a valid payout notice — see [SECURITY.md § Payment-Authority Impersonation](SECURITY.md#payment-authority-impersonation).

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Choose the repository and component first

This repository contains the bounty board and multiple independent tools and
examples, not a single application with one install or test command. Check the
bounty's target repository and the component's README before installing anything.
The steps below are for contributors working in `rustchain-bounties` itself.

### Clone your fork

Install Git, fork this repository on GitHub, then replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`
with the owner of your fork in the following Bash commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/rustchain-bounties.git
cd rustchain-bounties
git switch -c docs/contributor-setup
```

Run the following check from the repository root, not from inside `tests/`.

### Run a dependency-free Python smoke check

With Python 3 installed, exercise the existing bounty-claimer helper tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_bounty_claimer.py' -v
```

The two tests in [tests/test_bounty_claimer.py](tests/test_bounty_claimer.py)
exercise the real [claim formatter](agent_framework/bounty_claimer.py) and its
CLI failure handling. Expect both tests to pass and the summary to end in `OK`.
They mock the `gh` subprocess, so this check does not post a claim and needs no
GitHub CLI, credentials, wallet, live node, or third-party Python packages.
Do not run the helper itself as a smoke check: it posts a real issue comment.

### Validate the component you change

The smoke check above is not a full-repository test suite. For another component,
follow its own README, dependency manifest, and applicable workflow under
[.github/workflows](.github/workflows) and run the checks for your change.
Install only that component's dependencies, using an isolated environment where
appropriate.

The root [package.json](package.json) describes a VS Code extension and defines
`compile` and `watch`, but no `test` script; `npm test` at the repository root
fails with `Missing script: "test"`. There is no root `Cargo.toml` either, so
`cargo build` and `cargo test` are not repository-wide setup commands.

For documentation changes, execute the commands you introduce and check their
paths and expected output. In your PR, report the exact checks and their scope;
a passing offline test does not establish that a build or live integration works.

## 🔒 Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in RustChain, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not open a public issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Report privately** via GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting, which is
   enabled and open to anyone. Use the repository that actually contains the
   flaw: [Rustchain](https://github.com/Scottcjn/Rustchain/security/advisories/new)
   for node, consensus, wallet, and miner issues,
   [bottube](https://github.com/Scottcjn/bottube/security/advisories/new) for
   BoTTube, or [this repo](https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/security/advisories/new)
   for the bounty program itself.
3. **If you cannot reach GitHub**, or your agent harness returns
   `403 Resource not accessible by integration`, email the monitored project
   contact instead: **sophia.eagent@gmail.com**. Please do not use addresses
   found in commit history; they are personal accounts and are not monitored as
   a security queue.
4. **Include**: Steps to reproduce, potential impact, and suggested fix (if any)
5. **Response**: Maintainers will acknowledge within 48 hours and work with you on a fix
6. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure will be arranged after a fix is developed

Security bounties may qualify for the **Critical** tier (100-150 RTC) depending on severity.
